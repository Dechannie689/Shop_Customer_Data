## Abstract
This project leverages comprehensive data aggregation, analysis, and visualization in Power BI to uncover key insights into customer demographics. The Shop_Customer_Data.csv dataset analyzes how variables such as age, gender, annual income, profession, and spending score shape customer behavior and drive the shop’s growth.

## Data Manipulation
Prior to analysis, I imported the dataset into Power BI and transformed it on Power Query Editor. Here are the step-by-step manipulations done on the source datasets:
### Step 1: Replacement of missing values
Missing values in the "Profession" column are replaced with "Null"
### Step 2: Creation of Age Group Column
- Conditional formatting was applied to the “age” column to categorize customers into age group.
- A new column called “Age Group” was created based on the conditional formatting applied to the “age” column.
